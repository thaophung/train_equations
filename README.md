# train_equations 
# Choose only 10 examples of each mnist number class (10 examples of 0) from mnist_training_dataset
# Run for loop to create examples of equations -> total 100 examples of each equation -> 10,000 examples for training set
# Choose only 4 examples of each mnist number class from mnist_testing_dataset
# Run for loop to create examples of equations -> 16 examples for each equation -> 1600 examples for testing set
# Accuracy is low (0.1)
